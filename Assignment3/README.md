# In this README.md, I will present the files present and how to run it. 

## Open Assignment 3 Folder in IntelliJea:
	In this Assignment we were asked to implement the requirements from Assignment 3:  State Machines
	
	Files: 
	Diagrams: Contains Class Diagram which is similar to the  StatePattern produced in assignment and StateMachine followed
	SYSC3303Assignment3: contains the source fiels for the code/src
	README.md : this

	SYSC3303Assignment3:
	PELICAN:
	-Context: Context/System of machine, get events and go on state depending events
	-TestHarness: test the context without event(pedestrianWaiting())
	
	State:
	State: Abstract class which defines abstractly all state
	PedestrianSignal: An enum containing Pedestrian signals
	VehiclesSignal: An enum containing Vehicles singals
	
	Operational: First state of system(accessed only once)
	
	Vehicles:
		-VehiclesEnabled: First state when after operational, stop pedestrian, then traffic light go green for car
		-VehiclesGreen: traffic light goes green for 10s, then check where to go depending on if there pedestrian
		-VehiclesGreenInt: if not pedestrian, state stays here forever, else it goes to VehiclesYellow
		-VehiclesYellow: traffic light goes yellow, then goes to PedestriansEnabled

	Pedestrians:
		-PedestriansEnabled: traffic  light go red and then pedestrian gets to walk
		-PedestrianWalk: pedestrian walk, after it start flashing
		-PedestrianFlash: it starts flashing, then goes back to VehiclesEnabled
	
	
	
##run the project
	Run the main program in TestHarness.java
	Notice that one line will be commented depending on which state you would desire to go before going to pedestrian
	
## In Diagram Folder:
	Find:
	- 3 class diagrams(ClassDiagram Generated By Intellijea, ClassDiagram(Added Arrows) , StatePattern)
	We can see how similar the ClassDiagram Generated is to the StatePattern provided in the assignment
	
	-StateMachineFollowed
	Which is the statemachine is coded for this assignment

## Notes:
	-For isPedestrianWaiting and pedestrianFlashCtr, I've decided to make them as static variable in state

	-The assignment did not mention how long was the vehicles was suppose to be green
	An assumption fo 5s was made, then it will check whether there was a pedestrian or not

	-For pedestrianFlashCtr =7, I do not understand how it is used as Flash is only flashing for 2s
	This will make the Flash flash for 7s instead of 2s mentionned
